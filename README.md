# `%chess`

![Urbit Chess Demo](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess-ui/blob/master/images/demo.png?raw=true)

## About

`%chess` is an [Urbit](https://urbit.org) app which allows you to play chess with other Urbit users. It is a
fully-decentralized, peer-to-peer chess application.

This repo combines the [Urbit chess application](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess-app) with
[a browser-based GUI](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess-ui). It also generates
[the files necessary](https://docs.urbit.org/userspace/apps/reference/dist) to distribute the app + GUI over Urbit.

## Mission

Chess seeks to be a community sandbox:
- open to all contributors
- incorporating modern Hoon / Urbit programming techniques
- clear, concise, well-documented code
- a practical reference for beginner Hoon coders

Regardless of if Chess meets any or all of these goals at a particular moment, they are the aspirations for the repo.

## News

The `%chess` monorepo has been split into three: backend, frontend, and distribution.

## Installation

Chess is available on Urbit using the App Search in Landscape from the following ships:
```
~finmep-lanteb
```

Alternatively, you can install it manually from one of the above ships in the dojo:
```
|install ~finmep-lanteb %chess
```

## Development

This repo only contains the code necessary for distributing Chess as an Urbit app. To help contribute to the Chess
[backend](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess-app) or [frontend](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess-ui),
visit the linked repos for detailed instructions on how to contribute.
